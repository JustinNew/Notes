  - The time series we forecast are shaped by the rhythms of human civilization and its weekly, annual, and at-times irregular and evolving cycles. Calendaring was therefore an explicit feature of models within our framework, and we made considerable investment in maintaining detailed regional calendars.
  - Time series model vs explanatory model:
    - The main concern may be only to predict what will happen, not to know why it happens. 
    - The time series model may give more accurate forecasts than an explanatory or mixed model.
  - Our ultimate objective is to accurately forecast the expected growth trends of our time series.
    - cleaning adjustments: remove unpredictable nuisance artifacts
    - effects adjustments: regular patterns we wish to capture explicitly
      - holiday effects, seasonality effects, and day-of-week effects
      - Estimating holiday and seasonality effects is more art than science due to the paucity of relevant historical data

## Multi-armed Bandit Experimentation

  - [Multi-armed bandit experiments](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/2844870?hl=en)
    - The name "multi-armed bandit" describes a hypothetical experiment where you face several slot machines ("one-armed bandits") with potentially different expected payouts. You want to find the slot machine with the best payout rate, but you also want to maximize your winnings. The fundamental tension is between "exploiting" arms that have performed well in the past and "exploring" new or seemingly inferior arms in case they might perform even better.
