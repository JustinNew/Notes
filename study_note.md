  - The time series we forecast are shaped by the rhythms of human civilization and its weekly, annual, and at-times irregular and evolving cycles. Calendaring was therefore an explicit feature of models within our framework, and we made considerable investment in maintaining detailed regional calendars.
  - Time series model vs explanatory model:
    - The main concern may be only to predict what will happen, not to know why it happens. 
    - The time series model may give more accurate forecasts than an explanatory or mixed model.
  - Our ultimate objective is to accurately forecast the expected growth trends of our time series.
    - cleaning adjustments: remove unpredictable nuisance artifacts
    - effects adjustments: regular patterns we wish to capture explicitly
      - holiday effects, seasonality effects, and day-of-week effects
      - Estimating holiday and seasonality effects is more art than science due to the paucity of relevant historical data
